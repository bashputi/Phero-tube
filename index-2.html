      Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>In JavaScript, the keywords var, let, and const are a bit confusing. 
        So, in this shot, we will look at the differences between these keywords.</p>
        <b>Explanation:</b>
        <li>In the <span class="text-red-600">var</span> tab, when you will run the code, you will see an error as a is not defined because var variables are only accessible in the function scope.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="text-red-600">let</span> tab, when you run the code, you will see an error as i is not defined because let variables are only accessible within the block they are declared.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="text-red-600">const</span> tab, when you run the code, you will see that x was defined under the block was accessible, but when you try to access x outside that block, you will get an error.</li>

      Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>
        In programming, `<b>null</b>` and `<b>undefined</b>` are two distinct values that
        are often used to represent missing or absent data, but they are used in slightly
        different contexts and have different use cases:
        <br> <BR></BR>
        <P>1 `<b>null</b>` :</P> <br>
        <li><b>Explicit Absence</b>: It is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value or a placeholder for an object that doesn't exist. </li>
          <li><b>Assigned by the Programmer</b>: It is typically assigned by a programmer to indicate that a variable should have no value or that an object property intentionally has no reference.</li>
      </p>
      <p>2 `<b>undefined</b>` :</p> <br>
      <li><b>Implicit Absence</b>: It is a value that indicates the absence of a value, often because a variable has been declared but not assigned any value.
      </li>
      <li><b>Use Cases</b>: Some common use cases for undefined include checking if a variable has been initialized, determining if an object property exists, or detecting missing function arguments.</li>

      What do you mean by REST API?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>
        REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an 
        architectural style and a set of constraints for designing networked applications. REST
        is not a tecnology itself but rather a set of principles and constraints for creating web
        services that are scalable, stateless, and easy to maintain.  <br><br>
        <span>Here are some key Characteristics and principles of REST API's :</span>
